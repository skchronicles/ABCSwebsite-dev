Organizing and managing data is critical for developing any application. What is involved in designing and setting up a new database? The presentation will cover the different terms and types of SQL and NoSQL databases, aspects to consider before choosing a specific data management system for any research project and support offered for the NCI community.

Examples and use cases will be presented that demonstrate how SQL and NoSQL database back-ends were chosen for specific research applications.
